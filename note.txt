The only files to implement:
- libmfs.c
- server.c

Running & Testing

Server startup:
#1. Create a file system image: 

    Command: 
        gcc -o mkfs mkfs.c -Wall
        ./mkfs -f <image_file> [-d <num_data_blocks] [-i <num_inodes>]

    Description: 
        This runs mkfs.c to generate a on-disk file system image

#2. Run server:  
   
    Command: 
        server [portnum] [file-system-image]

    Description: 
        This creates a server using the file system image which acts as our disk

Client startup:
#3. Run client: 

    How:
        Call functions declared in libmfs.c in a main.c

    Description:
        Runs the client that communicates with the server.
